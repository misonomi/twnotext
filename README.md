# Twitter No Text firefox extension

The goal for this extension is to free people from the curse of SNS.

SNS like twitter keeps us from making right decision on how to spend time.
You may (or fortunately, may not) have spent time just swiping the timeline like factory robot without thinking, without getting anything.
You knew it's waste of time, you knew you definitely should haven't, you knew you were a moron then, but you did.
That is the curse of SNS.
They are flooding with information, consuming your brain CPU usage which supporsed to be used in important purpose: to think. 

As you know, it's hard to get out of there.
I don't know why it is (maybe it's confortable for brain not to think) but fear not.
We have power to resist the curse: Twitter No Text firefox extension.
Using this extension, you no longer see no text in your timeline tweets.
This will significantly reduces the amount of information on your timeline, leaving you enough neurons to think.

So, what's the difference between this extension, or simply not visiting twitter?
This extension still displays images.
There are may artwork that posted only in twitter.
This extension will be a great solution to see artworks on twitter without any side-effect.
